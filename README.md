Please check the maintainer`s site http://code.google.com/p/scxmlgui to get the latest official versions.

This repository is used to store and track changes to use the scxmlgui editor for a variant of scxml, which cannot called scxml anymore. The intention of this variant is introducing sub-FSM to avoid one large scxml file.
